<p>Hi, my name is Nelson.
    I'm 38 years old and currently live in Waterlooville, UK.
    I'm studying software development and this is my first semester on it so, everything is very new to me!
    Some of the things I love to do are playing video games, watch movies and spend time with my family. Lately, I have enjoyed riding bike with both my kids too!

    I'm married for 11 years and, me and my lovely wife, got 2 little boys. Logan with 6 years old, and Noah with 2 years old.

    <hr>Currently, I work at Coopervision, in Hamble, UK, as Technical Operator. I love my job and like very much the company values.
    Nevertheless, I would like to live in a place with more sun so I could enjoy outdoors' activities with my kids, more. For this reason, I still didn't give up of living in Canada or, maybe, USA. It would also work going back to my country, Portugal, but working for a different country. 
    This is where this bachelor's gets in place. My goal is to work from home in the future, or progress in the company...
    Working from home, allows me to work from anywhere. Progressing in the company gives me the chance of maybe asking transfer for one of the countries I mentioned, since Coopervision's HQ is in the USA.

P.S - After checking my webpage, I can't stop thinking how much I want to learn CSS to improve visuals!
