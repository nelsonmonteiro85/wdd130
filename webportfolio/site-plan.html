      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        BACKGROUND:
My name is Nelson Monteiro, and I was born in Porto, Portugal. Since young age I developed a big interest for technology. I’m always interested on what is new, modern, and progressive. 
In my early years, my family struggled a little bit and only when I started working, at the age of 16, I was finally able of buying my own desktop. I was new in this world but, researching and asking friends allowed me to develop myself on how to install/uninstall programs, troubleshoot several different issues and learn about hardware. In no time I was assembling computers for friends and upgrading my own. For this reason, I gain knowledge about software and hardware. On a later stage in my life, I was able to do some freelance jobs installing hardware and software, remotely.
During my “IT” journey, due to life circumstances, I saw myself obligated to set aside the technology path for different professional routes. I was able to work in a few different jobs in few different areas. This gave me maturity and a wider vision and background about the world’s evolution and future possibilities. Now, at the age of 38 years old, I’ve decided to hold onto all my knowledge and finally do what I always wanted.
Work with technologies.
What I like the most about this world is that the technologic world evolves very fast. I’m a person who likes challenges and to constantly learn and evolve. This is probably one of the main reasons why I feel so attracted to computers and all the things we can do with them.

ME:
I am an optimist and extremely approachable person who likes to hear others and respect their opinions and points of view. 
I got married when I was 27 years old and, alongside with being a father, being a husband is one of the most important things I achieved. I’m a dedicated family man who, through many different challenges, have changed accordingly. Usually, I’m a person who quickly adapts to changes.
 I’m lucky for having the wife I have by my side and due to her, I know I can accomplish “many” things. Due to this union, I am a father of 2 beautiful boys who, with my wife, complete me. I am Christian and a Latter Day Saint and due to this, I know I can accomplish the other “many” things!
I love spending time with my family, even when we are doing nothing. 
I have also developed a big interest for mountain biking, and I started pushing my family to join me. We have a blast and through this, I can connect with my other side. Even though I don’t see myself without technology, or in a world without internet, I love nature. Spending time with my family observing what God made for us, is a must for me.
