                    <h4>BACKGROUND:</h4>
                    <p class="backgrdp">
                        My name is Nelson Monteiro, and I was born in Porto, Portugal.
                    </p>
                    <p class="backgrdp">
                        Since young age I developed a biginterestfor technology. I’m always interested on what is new,
                        modern, and progressive.In my early years, my family struggled a little bit and only when I
                        started
                        working, at the age of16, Iwasfinally able of buying my own desktop. I was new in this world of
                        technologies but, researching and asking friendsallowedme to develop myself on how to
                        install/uninstall programs, troubleshoot several different issues andlearnabout hardware. In no
                        time
                        I was assembling computers for friends and upgrading my own. For thisreason,Igain knowledge
                        about
                        software and hardware.
                    </p>
                    <p class="backgrdp">
                        On a later stage in my life, I was able to do some freelance jobs installing hardware and
                        software,
                        remotely. During my “IT” journey, due to life circumstances, I saw myself obligated to set aside
                        the
                        technology path for different professional routes. I was able to work in a few different jobs in
                        few
                        different areas. This gave me maturity and a wider vision and background about the world’s
                        evolution
                        and future possibilities.
                    </p>
                    <p class="backgrdp"> Now, at the age of 38 years old, I’ve decided to hold onto all my knowledge and
                        finally do what I
                        always wanted. Work with technologies. 
                        What I like the most about this world is that the
                        technologic
                        world evolves very fast. I’m a person who likes challenges and to constantly learn and evolve.
                        This
                        is probably one of the main reasons why I feel so attracted to computers and all the things we
                        can
                        do with them.

                    <h4>ME:</h4>
                    <p class="mep">
                        I am an optimist and extremely approachable person who likes to hear others and respect their
                        opinions and points of view.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mep">
                        I got married when I was 27 years old and, alongside with being a father, being a husband is one
                        of
                        the most important things I achieved.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mep">
                        I’m a dedicated family man who, through many different challenges, have changed accordingly.
                        Usually, I’m a person who quickly adapts to changes. I’m lucky for having the wife I have by my
                        side
                        and due to her, I know I can accomplish “many” things. Due to this union, I am a father of 2
                        beautiful boys who, with my wife, complete me. I am Christian and a Latter Day Saint and due to
                        this, I know I can accomplish the other “many” things! I love spending time with my family, even
                        when we are doing nothing.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mep">
                        I have also developed a big interest for mountain biking, and I started pushing my family to
                        join me. We have a blast and through this, I can connect with my other side. Even though I don’t
                        see myself without technology, I love nature. Spending time with my family observing what God
                        made for us, is a must for me.
