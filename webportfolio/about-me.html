                        My name is Nelson Monteiro, and I was born in Porto, Portugal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since young age I developed a biginterestfor technology. I’m always interested on what is new,
                        modern, and progressive.In my early years, my family struggled a little bit and only when I started
                        working, at the age of16, Iwasfinally able of buying my own desktop. I was new in this world of
                        technologies but, researching and asking friendsallowedme to develop myself on how to
                        install/uninstall programs, troubleshoot several different issues andlearnabout hardware. In no time
                        I was assembling computers for friends and upgrading my own. For thisreason,Igain knowledge about
                        software and hardware.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On a later stage in my life, I was able to do some freelance jobs installing hardware and software,
                        remotely. During my “IT” journey, due to life circumstances, I saw myself obligated to set aside the
                        technology path for different professional routes. I was able to work in a few different jobs in few
                        different areas. This gave me maturity and a wider vision and background about the world’s evolution
                        and future possibilities.
                    </p>
                    <p> Now, at the age of 38 years old, I’ve decided to hold onto all my knowledge and finally do what I
                        always wanted. Work with technologies. What I like the most about this world is that the technologic
                        world evolves very fast. I’m a person who likes challenges and to constantly learn and evolve. This
                        is probably one of the main reasons why I feel so attracted to computers and all the things we can
                        do with them.

                        I am an optimist and extremely approachable person who likes to hear others and respect their
                        opinions and points of view.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I got married when I was 27 years old and, alongside with being a father, being a husband is one of
                        the most important things I achieved.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’m a dedicated family man who, through many different challenges, have changed accordingly.
                        Usually, I’m a person who quickly adapts to changes. I’m lucky for having the wife I have by my side
                        and due to her, I know I can accomplish “many” things. Due to this union, I am a father of 2
                        beautiful boys who, with my wife, complete me. I am Christian and a Latter Day Saint and due to
                        this, I know I can accomplish the other “many” things! I love spending time with my family, even
                        when we are doing nothing. I have also developed a big interest for mountain biking, and I started
                        pushing my family to join me. We have a blast and through this, I can connect with my other side.
                        Even though I don’t see myself without technology, I love nature. Spending time with my family
                        observing what God made for us, is a must for me.
