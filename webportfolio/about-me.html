        <p>BACKGROUND:
            My name is Nelson Monteiro, and I was born in Porto, Portugal. Since young age I developed a big interest
            for technology. I’m always interested on what is new, modern, and progressive.
            In my early years, my family struggled a little bit and only when I started working, at the age of 16, I was
            finally able of buying my own desktop. I was new in this world but, researching and asking friends allowed
            me to develop myself on how to install/uninstall programs, troubleshoot several different issues and learn
            about hardware. In no time I was assembling computers for friends and upgrading my own. For this reason, I
            gain knowledge about software and hardware. On a later stage in my life, I was able to do some freelance
            jobs installing hardware and software, remotely.
            During my “IT” journey, due to life circumstances, I saw myself obligated to set aside the technology path
            for different professional routes. I was able to work in a few different jobs in few different areas. This
            gave me maturity and a wider vision and background about the world’s evolution and future possibilities.
            Now, at the age of 38 years old, I’ve decided to hold onto all my knowledge and finally do what I always
            wanted.
            Work with technologies.
            What I like the most about this world is that the technologic world evolves very fast. I’m a person who
            likes challenges and to constantly learn and evolve. This is probably one of the main reasons why I feel so
            attracted to computers and all the things we can do with them.

            ME:
            I am an optimist and extremely approachable person who likes to hear others and respect their opinions and
            points of view.
            I got married when I was 27 years old and, alongside with being a father, being a husband is one of the most
            important things I achieved. I’m a dedicated family man who, through many different challenges, have changed
            accordingly. Usually, I’m a person who quickly adapts to changes.
            I’m lucky for having the wife I have by my side and due to her, I know I can accomplish “many” things. Due
            to this union, I am a father of 2 beautiful boys who, with my wife, complete me. I am Christian and a Latter
            Day Saint and due to this, I know I can accomplish the other “many” things!
            I love spending time with my family, even when we are doing nothing.
            I have also developed a big interest for mountain biking, and I started pushing my family to join me. We
            have a blast and through this, I can connect with my other side. Even though I don’t see myself without
            technology, or in a world without internet, I love nature. Spending time with my family observing what God
            made for us, is a must for me.
